# Task ID: 92
# Title: Implement Scheduling System for Periodic Task Execution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 11, 17, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system that allows tasks to be scheduled with custom time intervals and timezone configuration, enabling periodic execution of tasks at specified times.
# Details:
1. Design the scheduling system architecture to support:
   - Custom time intervals (e.g., every X minutes/hours/days)
   - Timezone configuration
   - Task prioritization in scheduling
2. Implement the core scheduling functionality:
   - Create a scheduler service that manages scheduled tasks
   - Develop task execution logic based on schedules
   - Integrate with existing task management system (Task 3)
3. Add user interface for scheduling tasks:
   - Create command-line options for setting up scheduled tasks
   - Implement configuration validation and error handling (Task 19)
4. Ensure proper logging of scheduled tasks and their execution (Task 17)
5. Handle timezone conversions accurately
6. Implement batch scheduling operations (Task 11)
7. Add support for recurring tasks with complex schedules (e.g., cron-like syntax)
8. Integrate with the existing task data structure (Task 1)

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that tasks can be scheduled with various time intervals and timezone configurations
2. Test scheduling edge cases (e.g., overlapping schedules, different timezones)
3. Check proper execution of scheduled tasks at specified times
4. Validate logging of scheduled task executions
5. Ensure error handling works correctly for invalid schedule configurations
6. Test batch scheduling operations
7. Verify timezone conversion accuracy
